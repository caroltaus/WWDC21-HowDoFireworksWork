 Aren't fireworks just the _prettiest_?!  😍
 
 My name is Caroline and I've always been fascinated with them and wondered how they worked, especially their colors.

 This, among many other curiosities, ended up influencing my academic career. I studied chemistry in college, and found out all about what happens in an atomic level when you light up fireworks!
 
 So, if you want to learn a little bit more about them come with me to the [next page](@next). Also, by the end of this playground you will be able to create your own fireworks! But don't worry, these ones are not dangerous at all and, better yet, won't even scare your pets with loud noises!  😺
