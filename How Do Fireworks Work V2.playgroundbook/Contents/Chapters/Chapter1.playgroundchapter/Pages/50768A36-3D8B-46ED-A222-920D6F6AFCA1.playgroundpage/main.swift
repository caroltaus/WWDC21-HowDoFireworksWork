 # How does it work?
 
  Hey, I'm so glad you came!
 
    
 ### The Atom
 Look! This is the representation of a Lithium atom!  ⚛️
  
 At the center there is its nucleus, with three protons (the red circles 🔴) and four neutrons (yellow circles 🟡). And orbiting around it its three electrons (blue circles 🔵).
 Did you notice that one of the electrons is orbiting in a more external orbit than the other two? That electron is a **valence electron**.

 ### Jumping to an Excited State

 When the atom receives energy, this electron jumps to an outer shell, making it now an **excited-state atom**.
 
 Let's give our Lithium atom some energy? Click on the match to light it up and heat up that atom!  🔥
 
 Do you see how the electron that jumped orbitals is now pulsating a little? It's doing that because this is a very **unstable state**!
 
 * * * * *
 
 ### Back to Ground State
 We should bring the electron back to it's **ground state** and make this atom stable again! Click on the match again to do that.
 **HEY!** Did you just see that??
 The energy that was absorbed previously was released as **light energy**!  ⚡
 
The color of this light depends on its wavelength, and **atoms of different elements produce light of different wavelengths, which means different colors**!  🎆

 - Note:
     We should keep in mind that all of these things that we just saw happen very VERY fast in real life, that's why we see the pretty colors as soon as the fireworks explode!
 
 * * * * *
 
 So now that we know all of this, let's go to the next page and choose the elements to make our own fireworks!
